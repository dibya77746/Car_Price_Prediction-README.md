🚘 Task 2 Completed – Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning 🤖📈

Grateful to @InternPe for guiding me through another exciting project in my AI & ML journey! 🌟🙏

In this task, I built a Car Price Prediction Model using Machine Learning that takes into account multiple car features and predicts its estimated price with high accuracy! 💰🚗


---

🔍 What I Did:

✅ Collected and explored car data 📊
✅ Visualized key features affecting car prices (like year, fuel type, transmission)
✅ Preprocessed the data & trained ML models
✅ Evaluated and optimized model performance
✅ Deployed a Flask-based mini web app for real-time predictions! 🚀

🧰 Tech Stack & Tools Used:

Component	Details

💻 IDE	Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
🐍 Language	Python
📦 Libraries	pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, scikit-learn, Flask
🔍 ML Concepts	Linear Regression, Feature Engineering, Data Preprocessing, Model Evaluation
🌐 Deployment	Flask (local web app interface)

📂 Dataset Used:

✅ Dataset Name: Quikr Car Price Dataset

📥 Source: Kaggle - Vehicle Dataset from Cardekho (quikr_car.csv)

🖥 How It Works – Step-by-Step:

1. User inputs car details on the web form (Year, Fuel Type, Seller Type, Transmission, KM Driven, etc.).


2. The backend Flask server loads the trained model.


3. The model uses the input data to predict the price using LinearRegression.


4. The predicted price is returned and displayed on the web page. 💰

📤 Output Sample:

> 🔧 Input:
Year: 2014, Fuel Type: Petrol, Transmission: Manual, KM Driven: 41000, Present Price: 5.5L, etc.

📈 Output:
✅ Estimated Selling Price: ₹3.72 Lakhs
