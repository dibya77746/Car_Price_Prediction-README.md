🚗 Task 2: Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning 💸📈

> "Predict the price of your dream car before buying it!" 🔍🚘💡
Built with 💻 Python | 🛠 VS Code | 📊 ML Libraries | 📁 Kaggle Dataset




---

📌 Project Description:

In this project, I developed a Car Price Prediction Model using Machine Learning. The model learns from historical car data and predicts the approximate market price of a car based on its specifications such as year, fuel type, seller type, transmission, km driven, etc.


---

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used:

👨‍💻 IDE: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

🐍 Language: Python

📦 Libraries Used:

pandas – For data loading & manipulation

numpy – For numerical operations

matplotlib & seaborn – For data visualization

scikit-learn – For ML modeling (train-test split, regression, metrics)

joblib – For saving the model

📂 Dataset Used:

📊 Dataset Name: quikr_car.csv

🌐 Source: Kaggle Dataset Link

⚙ How to Run the Project:

1. ✅ Clone the repository to your system


2. ✅ Install required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt


3. ✅ Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script


4. ✅ Model gets trained and tested automatically


5. ✅ Save the trained model using joblib


6. ✅ Provide new car details → Get predicted price 💰




---

🧠 How the Model Works:

The model is trained on labeled data where each row represents a car with attributes like:

Year of Purchase

Present Price

Kilometers Driven

Fuel Type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)

Seller Type (Individual/Dealer)

Transmission (Manual/Automatic)

Owner History


🔁 The model uses Linear Regression (or another ML model) to learn from the features and find patterns to predict the price.

📥 Input Features:

🛠 Input:
- Car Name
- Year of Purchase
- Present Price
- KMs Driven
- Fuel Type
- Seller Type
- Transmission Type
- No. of Previous Owners


---

📤 Output Example:

🎯 Predicted Car Price: ₹3.75 Lakhs


---

📈 Outcome:

✅ High Accuracy on test data
✅ Model can predict unseen car prices accurately
✅ Helps in understanding market trends & fair pricing
